To whom it may concern, \par \medskip

I have worked in IT Operations for two years since graduating from a masters programme at University College London. This experience has provided me with valuable insight into how data makes an organisation tick and how triaging issues and problems effectively provides exemplary service to end-users. I have gained this experience working for a household name television shopping channel in the UK -- a fast-paced environment with many issues encountered meaning loss of sales, financial loss and customer retention being affected unless quickly resolved.\medskip

At this employer, the IT team was particularly small meaning that I had opportunities for direct exposure to various technologies, departments and systems. For instance, I had the opportunity to work with the Database Manager to assist in running SQL queries against one of our databases to correct records of manual BNPL payments taken by our off-shore customer service team. This sparked an interest in me to self-study SQL and databasing, which I continue to do in my spare time today. Further, on the back of this self-study, I am looking into certification, in particular Datacamp's data analyst/engineer certifications as well as Microsoft's DP-900. \medskip

I also had the opportunity to work closely with the Development Team on occasion, gaining insight into how code is managed, how the Test Team operated and had the opportunity to gain experience with Agile methodologies during a data center migration wherein I was responsible for tracking, organising and visualising the tasks that needed to be performed. This was done via Azure DevOps. Much like the opportunity presented to me in database work, this also has me on path of self-study, learning about Agile methodologies and considering certification in Scrum. \medskip

Another opportunity I had was working with the Infrastructure Team, where I learned (and still am via self-study of the CCNA certification) the basics of networking, user and device management in an organisation and technologies such as Azure. Again, I am self-studying Azure through the AZ-900 certification and am creating a homelab to explore more networking principles, technologies and trends. \medskip

All in all, the opportunities that have been presented to me over the last two years in my current role have lead me to the conclusion that I am eager and ready for a challenge. I am excited and enthused at the thought of understanding complex technology issues; getting my hands dirty with vast data sets; learning about how a technology-first organisation operates and getting to the core of the problems at hand. \medskip

I am ready for the next stage in my IT career, and I believe this role is the one that will challenge me, grow me, and provide experiences and knowledge unmatched to any other. \medskip

Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope to hear back soon. \medskip

Sincerely, \par \medskip
